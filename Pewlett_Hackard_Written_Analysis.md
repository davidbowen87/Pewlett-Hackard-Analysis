Of this count, the department with the largest impact is the Senior Engineer department with 25,916 employees that are becoming eligible. The Manager department has the lowest impact with only 2 employees becoming eligible for retirement.

    Through the second part of this analysis, we have identified that 1,549 employees are eligible for mentorship at Packard-Hewlett. 

## Summary of the analysis.

    The summary of this analysis is that the "silver tsunami" consists of roughly 30% of the current emoployees. This percentage is broken down by the 72,458 employees that are becomming eligible for retirement out of the 240,124 current employees that Packard-Hewlett has. 
    
    The total employee count that is eligible for mentorship is only 1,549 and that is only roughly 2% of the silver tsunami. It does not appear that there are enough employees eligible for mentorship to properly mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
